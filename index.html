                    <p>Malka’s creative and professional journey is grounded in emotional honesty and social awareness. Whether on-screen, in writing, or through technology, she speaks from lived experience — driven by the belief that women’s stories must be told from within, not from expectation.</p>
                    <p>She doesn’t aim to fit into existing systems but instead creates new ones — where emotion is valued, pain is a source of insight, and vulnerability is a tool for connection. Her work expands the boundaries of what’s considered legitimate, meaningful, and visible.</p>

                    <p>In the 2010s and 2020s, Malka became a prominent figure in Israeli media. While the public conversation often drifted toward cynicism or spectacle, she offered a poetic and deeply personal voice. Her storytelling was intimate and political, often placing her own voice and body at the center — not for provocation, but for truth.</p>
                    <p>In 2033, she launched SheKnows, an independent streaming service dedicated to entertainment and socially driven content. The platform featured documentaries, dramas, news, and original formats that explored the human and social dimensions of everyday life. Designed as a cultural lab, SheKnows became a space for bold, nuanced discussions and diverse perspectives — prioritizing depth, emotional truth, and creative experimentation.</p>
                    <p>Malka's editorial voice made her a model for many, especially women, proving that one can be assertive without apology, vulnerable without collapse, and politically engaged without partisanship.</p>

                    <p>Malka’s acting career pushed beyond traditional female roles. She chose characters that were layered, emotional, ambitious — and often challenged societal expectations. Her performances didn’t settle for stereotypes; they demanded recognition of women’s full complexity.</p>
                    <p>In the 2028 series <i>Beyond All Borders</i>, she portrayed a sharp, strong character that broke with conventions and earned critical acclaim. She frequently used her platform to criticize the entertainment industry’s limited view of women and to advocate for richer, more truthful representation.</p>

                    <p>In 2040, Malka founded DataSoul, a technology company dedicated to advancing women’s health through AI, data, and medical innovation. Her mission was to develop tools that address the specific and often overlooked medical needs of women.</p>
                    <p>The company’s platforms analyze personal health data, helping medical professionals make better, more personalized decisions while respecting privacy and individual experience. DataSoul is not only a tech initiative but a cultural one — promoting a shift in how women’s health is understood, researched, and respected.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p>Malka was born in Tel Aviv to a Moroccan immigrant family. Raised in a conservative environment with strong community values, she began early on to question gender roles and societal expectations.</p>
                    <p>She pursued academic studies at top institutions, seeing education not just as personal advancement but as a tool for social transformation. Rather than avoid her personal struggles, she turned them into sources of strength — sharing her journey with honesty and openness through her work.</p>
                    <p>Malka married music editor and cultural producer Ofri Gofer, who passed away suddenly in 2025. She has spoken publicly about grief and healing through creative expression. She continues to live in Tel Aviv, dividing her time between writing, public speaking, and activism.</p>
